<h1>NC-News-front-end</h1>
<p>This project represents the frontend repository of the Northcoders News Web-based application. This was completed as part of the Northcoders Software Engineering bootcamp. Much like websites such as Reddit or Quora this displays a homepage that allows a user to view every article, as well as filter articles by topic and sort them by different parameters. The user can also read each article, vote and leave comments.</p>

<p>The backend repository as well as its description can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/jimp66/nc-news-back-end">nc-news-back-end</a>
